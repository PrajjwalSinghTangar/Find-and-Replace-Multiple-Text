Find and Replace Multiple Text

Here are detailed instructions on how to use the website, including the required CSV file format:

Open the Find and Replace Multiple Text website in your web browser.

You will see a text area labeled "Paste your content below." This is where you can input the text in which you want to find and replace multiple values.

Copy the content you want to process and paste it into the text area.

Below the text area, you will find an option to upload a CSV file. The CSV file should have two columns: "Original" and "Replace". Each row in the CSV file represents a pair of values to find and replace. The "Original" column contains the text you want to find, and the "Replace" column contains the text you want to replace it with. Make sure the CSV file is saved in the correct format.

The CSV file should be in plain text format.
Each row should represent a pair of values.
The values should be separated by a comma (,) character.
There should be no additional headers or rows in the CSV file.
Example CSV file format:

mathematica
Copy code
Original,Replace
Lorem,Ipsum
dolor,sit
amet,consectetur
Click the "Choose File" or "Browse" button next to the file upload option. Locate and select the CSV file from your local computer.

Once the CSV file is selected, the website will display the contents of the CSV file under the "CSV Data" section. You can verify if the CSV data is correctly loaded.

Scroll back up to the top of the page. You will see the list of values extracted from the uploaded CSV file under the "Your Values" section. These are the pairs of values that will be used for the find and replace operation.

Click the "Find and Replace" button. The website will find all occurrences of the values in the input text and replace them accordingly. The modified text will appear in the same text area where you originally pasted the content.

If you want to download a sample CSV file to understand the required format, you can click the "Download Sample CSV" button located below the "Find and Replace" button. This will download a sample CSV file named "sample.csv" with pre-filled values as an example.
