Find and Replace Multiple Text
This is a simple web tool that allows you to find and replace multiple text values in a given content using a CSV file. The tool supports the regular expression syntax for advanced matching.

How to Use
Open the Find and Replace Multiple Text website in your web browser.

Copy the content you want to perform find and replace on, and paste it into the "Paste your content below" textarea.

Prepare your CSV file with the following format:

The CSV file should have two columns: "Original" and "Replace".
Each row in the CSV file represents a text value to find and replace.
The "Original" column should contain the text value you want to find.
The "Replace" column should contain the text value you want to replace it with.

Example CSV file:
Original,Replace
Lorem,Ipsum
dolor,sit
amet,consectetur

Click on the "Upload a CSV file" button, and select your prepared CSV file.

Once the CSV file is uploaded, you will see the content of the CSV file displayed under the "CSV Data" section.

Review the values in the CSV file to ensure they match your intended find and replace criteria.

Click on the "Find and Replace" button to perform the find and replace operation on the content you pasted in step 2.

The updated content with the replacements will be shown in the "Paste your content below" textarea.

If you want to download a sample CSV file with the correct format, you can click on the "Download Sample CSV" button.

If you want to perform another find and replace operation, you can repeat the steps starting from step 2.
